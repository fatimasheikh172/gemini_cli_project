# Gemini CLI Project

## 📌 What is Gemini CLI?

**Gemini CLI** is a powerful open-source command-line tool that brings Google’s advanced **Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model** directly into your terminal.  
It allows developers to use natural language to:

- Generate code  
- Fix bugs  
- Analyze large projects  
- Create files  
- Automate development workflows  
- Interact with multimodal inputs (images, PDFs, sketches)

Gemini CLI is designed to streamline development and provide AI assistance at every step — right from the terminal.

## 🔥 Why Gemini CLI is Important

### **1. 1 Million Token Context Window**  
Gemini CLI can understand entire large codebases, long documents, and complex project structures.

### **2. AI-Assisted Development**  
Write, debug, refactor, and explain code using simple natural-language commands.

### **3. Workflow Automation**  
Automate tasks like documentation, reviews, scripts, or pull-request summaries.

### **4. Multimodal Support**  
Reads and analyzes text, images, PDFs, and sketches to generate UI, designs, or code.

### **5. Integrates with MCP**  
Supports **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — enabling integrations with APIs, tools, and custom workflows.

### **6. Free & Open Source**  
Available under the **Apache 2.0 License**, with a generous free usage tier.

### **7. Secure & Configurable**  
Includes features like:  
- `.geminiignore` for excluding sensitive data  
- Trusted folder system  
- Headless mode for automation in CI/CD or scripts
